# flight-attach

A Flight component for automatic component attachments through declarative binding.


## Installation

```
npm install & bower install
```

## Unit tests

A local installation of Karma is used to run the JavaScript unit tests.
Karma makes it easy to watch files and run unit tests in real browsers:

```
npm run watch-test
```

This is the recommended approach because the moment your unit tests start
failing, you'll be notified in the terminal.

To run the unit tests just once in PhantomJS (for CI), you must install
PhantomJS and then run:

```
npm test
```

For further information about configuring Karma, please refer to the [Karma
website](http://karma-runner.github.io/).
